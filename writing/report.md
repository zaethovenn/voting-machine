how your concept is motivated by the cryptocurrency-related technology and what existing or potential solutions might it provide to our challenges?

## Design of your Project

This section should provide detailed description of your design. Please include a visual representation of the design of your project. This could include a technical diagram or a flowchart demonstrating how your concept works, a walk through a conceptual example, etc. 

## Implementation

This section should describe implementation details of your project (how you implemented your solution). Please describe which languages, libraries, external tools you used. This section should also provide commands (in code blocks) that are needed to run your implementation and what is needed to be installed beforehand. 

## Evaluation and Testing

This section should concentrate on how you conducted evaluation of your solution. You should test your implementation with different inputs (at least ten, if it makes sense) to verify its correctness, efficiency, effectiveness, etc. as appropriate for your project. Please include the input and a sample output in code blocks or indicate where these inputs/outputs are located  (as appropriate given your implementation). Automated testing is preferred but manual testing is acceptable. You must describe the type of testing that have been done and include the output of test cases in code blocks if appropriate.

## Description of the challenges that you faced and how you resolved them

## If worked in a team, description of the way in which you and your team members shared the project work
