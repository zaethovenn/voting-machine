# Title: Blockchain Voting Platform

## Kai'lani Woodard, Robert McMaster

## Description of the Concept

Our proposed concept is a blockchain based voting platform. Using java/python, we will implement a fully running blockchain platform that allows the user to vote ananomously and securely.

## Relevance and Motivation of the Concept

Recently the security of our nation's election software has been called into question.
Although we believe that it is secure, we believe that it could be more secure, which could be obtained through the implementation of blockchain technology.

## Description of the Tasks to Complete

In order to complete this project, the following tasks will need to be completed:

- implement blockchain data structure
- generation of public and private keys
- ability to access results of voting
- if time permits, deploy it on a web server so multiple people can acccess it as once
